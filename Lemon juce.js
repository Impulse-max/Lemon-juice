Cut the lemons lengthwise in half with a sharp knife.
 Most people cut across the width of a lemon. Instead of doing that,
  make a vertical cut down the center of each lemon. 
  It makes the lemon halves easier to squeeze,
 allowing you to get a little more juice out of them.
 put it in a glass and add sugar and mix  well .
 Enjoy.
